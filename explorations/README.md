# Explorations

Research sandbox for experimental work. Use the **Fast-Track** workflow (60/100 quality threshold).

## How to Use

1. Create a subfolder: `mkdir -p explorations/[name]/{R,scripts,output}`
2. Add a README.md from `templates/exploration-readme.md`
3. Code freely -- no plan needed, just document your goal
4. When done: graduate to production, keep exploring, or archive

See `.claude/rules/exploration-fast-track.md` for details.
